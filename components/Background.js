        I'm currently an Engineer at Upstatement building things for the web with some awesome people. I recently graduated from Northeastern University after completing three awesome six-month co-ops at MullenLowe U.S., Starry, and Apple Music.

        As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design — combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.
