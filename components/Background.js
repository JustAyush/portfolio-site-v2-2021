          As a software developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering
          and design â€” combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for
          design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build
          applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while
          providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.
